We begin assembling the Arduino system by first selecting the Arduino UNO type using the Tinkercad system.
In this we select the items necessary for assembly, such as:
* Colorful LEDs
* "PIR" sensor
*LCD Display
*Piezo
* flash LEDs

However, as it is a prototype, many other features can be used in the final product.
